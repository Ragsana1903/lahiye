                    <p>I get it, running a business is hard. I've been right where you are. I'm here to make your
                        branding and website journey less overwhelming. I've been in the business for over 12 years and
                        understand how to take your branding and website from zero to 100 with a streamlined and
                        enjoyable process. For many years I worked for large companies in the corporate world
                        implementing clear brand strategies and the best website practices. I've taken that knowledge
                        and expertise away to help smaller business owners get clarity on their audience and set up a
                        solid foundation to help them grow.</p>
